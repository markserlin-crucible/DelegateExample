# DelegateExample
Delegate function, events and some basic inheritance

A really simple project to demostrate using a delegate function in a timer loop to complete some task or other.
There's other ways of doing this like using an Action, this is just one way.
Also a demo of a basic event - can also do one that passes params but this is just a simple thing like raising a flag.
There's some basic inheritance going on with the listeners to this event just for fun :)
